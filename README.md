# Survey Analytic Techniques with Streamlit
This interactive app demonstrates some machine learning techniques that can be applied to survey data.
<br>
<br>
Organisations collect lots of data every day through surveys, to get feedback, understand user behaviour, track trends across time etc.
<br>
It can be resource intensive to craft a good survey and getting responders to fill in their answers, and we should make full use of the data obtained.
<br>
<br>
Processing and analysing the data is tedious and time-consuming but it doesn't have to be!
<br>
We can employ the help of machines to comb through the data and provide actionable insights.  
<br>
<br>
Techniques include:
<br>
Factor Analysis - Clustering responders based on their answers
<br>
Topic Modelling - Uncovering topics from text responses
<br>
Zero-shot Classification - Classifying text responses into user-defined labels
<br>
Sentiment Analysis - Quantifying sentiment of responders' text responses
